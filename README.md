What is PMN?

PMN (Pivotal Mining Note) is a Bitcoin mining–backed financial product
designed for long-term Bitcoin accumulation.

It is built on:
	•	Real-world mining infrastructure
	•	A fixed-term hashrate structure
	•	U.S.-compliant financial frameworks

This flashcard project aims to explain why PMN exists, what problems it addresses, and how it differs from simply buying Bitcoin — without requiring prior knowledge.
